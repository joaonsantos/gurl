# Gurl 

Basic curl functionality but in Go.

## Installation

Simply run:

```sh
go install github.com/joaonsantos/gurl@latest
```

At this point the binary should be in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

If this directory is in `$PATH`, then just call `gurl` anywhere in your terminal.


## Testing

Run `go test` in the working directory.
